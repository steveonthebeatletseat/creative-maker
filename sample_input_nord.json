  "product_description": "A comfort strap for the Meta Quest 2/3/3S with an integrated battery pack that adds 4 extra hours of playtime. Easier to adjust than the stock strap, significantly more comfortable for long sessions, and the built-in battery means you never have to stop mid-game to charge. The counterweight design balances the headset so it doesn't front-load on your face. Quick-release mechanism, premium padding, and USB-C passthrough charging. Designed for gamers, fitness VR users, and anyone who wants a better Quest experience without cables or external battery packs dangling off the back.",
