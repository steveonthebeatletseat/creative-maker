# What the world's best direct response marketers put in their research reports

**The best direct response marketers spend 40–80% of their total project time on research before writing a single word of copy.** This isn't a suggestion — it's the documented practice of copywriters who have collectively generated billions in trackable revenue. Across every legendary practitioner and high-performing agency studied, a clear consensus emerges: market research reports for direct response contain seven core pillars — prospect psychology, voice-of-customer language, competitive intelligence, product mechanism analysis, awareness/sophistication classification, emotional driver mapping, and proof element assembly. The specific frameworks differ in terminology, but the underlying components are remarkably consistent from Eugene Schwartz in the 1960s through Stefan Georgi's AI-augmented RMBC II in 2025. What follows is a synthesis of the actual processes, templates, and required components used by the practitioners with the highest documented conversion rates in the industry.

## Research consumes most of the work — and the legends prove it

Gary Bencivenga, widely regarded as the greatest living direct response copywriter, established what might be called the founding law of the discipline. His mentor John Caples advised him to **gather seven times more information than he could possibly use**. Bencivenga spent roughly **40% of his total project time on pure research** across a 90-day engagement — approximately 300 hours before assembling copy. His diagnosis of writer's block was blunt: "Writing is not spontaneous creative combustion. If you're facing writer's block as a copywriter, it just means you haven't done enough research."

Eugene Schwartz, author of *Breakthrough Advertising*, described his process as a five-week cycle: two weeks of deep product immersion (reading every manuscript page, underlining every significant claim), two weeks organizing claims into a master document, and one final week assembling copy. His foundational principle — **"Copy is not written. It is assembled"** — reframes the entire copywriting discipline as a research and assembly operation rather than a creative writing exercise. Jeremy Mac, a modern practitioner who follows Schwartz's method, creates **30+ page research documents** before drafting, reading them three times: first for comprehension, second to mark emotional triggers and benefits, third to extract copy elements.

At Agora Publishing, the largest direct response publisher in the world, Joe Schriefer (former copy chief of Agora Financial) articulated their philosophy: "They don't need to be creative because the ideas don't come from inside their head. They're discovered through the research process we teach them. Through the reading." Agora hires for intellectual curiosity, not marketing talent, because they've learned that the quality of research directly determines the quality of the promotion.

## The seven pillars every top-tier research report contains

Analysis across all documented frameworks — from Carlton's 17-Step Simple Writing System to Georgi's RMBC to CXL's ResearchXL — reveals seven components that appear universally in the research reports that precede high-converting direct response campaigns.

**Pillar 1: Prospect/Avatar deep profile.** Every framework begins here. This goes far beyond demographics. John Carlton's Simple Writing System mandates answering: Who are you selling to? What are their needs? Where does it hurt? What does she need to hear to feel good about buying? DigitalMarketer's Customer Avatar Worksheet structures this into five sections — goals and values, challenges and pain points, sources of information (using Ryan Deiss's "but no one else would" trick to find niche media), demographics, and objections with role in purchase decision. Clayton Makepeace required answers to **14 specific questions about the prospect** covering objections, overriding desires, how to establish instant trust, and what makes the purchase feel mandatory. Todd Brown's E5 Examine phase demands research into what the prospect already knows and believes about their problem, the ideal solution, your product, and your competitors — because "all profitable marketing funnels begin with the prospect's existing beliefs."

**Pillar 2: Voice-of-customer language mining.** This is perhaps the single most actionable research component. Joanna Wiebe of Copyhackers pioneered the now-standard Amazon review mining process, demonstrating its power with a landmark case study: for Beachway Rehab Center, she mined 500+ Amazon reviews of addiction books, extracted the phrase "If you think you need rehab, you do" from an actual reviewer, used it as a headline, and generated **400% more CTA clicks** and **20% more form submissions** than the control. Her Google search shortcut — `site:amazon.com inurl:"product-reviews" "tired of" ~keyword` — lets researchers go directly to pain-point-rich language. Stefan Georgi teaches Amazon book review mining as a core RMBC technique, specifically looking for "how they talk, not just what they talk about." The sources extend beyond Amazon to Reddit, Facebook groups, Quora, support tickets, sales call transcripts, and app store reviews. The output is a categorized spreadsheet of exact customer phrases organized by pain points, desires, hesitations, and outcomes.

**Pillar 3: Competitive and market intelligence.** Schwartz's five levels of market sophistication form the foundation here. At level one (first to market), simple direct claims work. At level three, you must introduce a unique mechanism. At level five (totally jaded market), you shift entirely to identification-based messaging. Determining where your market sits requires studying every competitor's marketing — their promises, claims, mechanisms, offer structures, and positioning. Todd Brown's Examine phase explicitly catalogs competitors' primary promises, whether they use unique mechanisms, and what claims have already been made, specifically to avoid the "mental opt-out" that occurs when prospects think "I've heard that before." Modern tools for this include Meta Ad Library, SpyFu, SimilarWeb, and ClickBank marketplace analysis. Alex Cattoni teaches using Udemy, Coursera, and Shopify as competitive intelligence sources because these platforms have already categorized competitors by niche.

**Pillar 4: Product mechanism analysis.** This component separates amateur from professional direct response. Todd Brown introduced the formal "unique mechanism" concept in 2012, though it traces directly to Schwartz's market sophistication framework. The research task is to interrogate the product until you find what makes it uniquely deliver results — the specific "how and why" that differentiates it from every alternative. Stefan Georgi refined this into a **two-part mechanism**: one part explaining why the problem exists (and why other solutions failed), and one part explaining why your solution is the only one that works. Evaldo Albuquerque's "16-Word Sales Letter" formula crystallizes this as: "This [new opportunity] is the key to [their desire] and it's only attainable through [new mechanism]." Clayton Makepeace required answers to **10 specific product questions** before writing, focusing on extracting features, converting them to benefits, and identifying the core promise that no competitor can match.

**Pillar 5: Awareness and sophistication classification.** Schwartz's five levels of customer awareness — Most Aware, Product Aware, Solution Aware, Problem Aware, and Unaware — determine the entire architecture of the copy. A Most Aware prospect needs only a deal. An Unaware prospect requires indirect storytelling before any product mention. Research must determine precisely where the target audience sits on this spectrum, because it dictates headline strategy, copy length, lead type, and overall approach. Todd Brown formalized this as the first element of his A.S.I.S.T. framework (Awareness level, Sophistication level, Big Idea, Structure, Offer). Joanna Wiebe begins every Copyhackers engagement by determining awareness stage because it governs the entire copy structure. The research involves analyzing what prospects already know, what they've tried, and how much education they need before a product pitch makes sense.

**Pillar 6: Emotional driver mapping.** Georgi reads his 30+ page research documents three times, with the second pass specifically dedicated to **marking every emotional trigger** — both positive (hope, excitement, relief, pride) and negative (fear, frustration, shame, anger). Evaldo Albuquerque's 10 sequential questions are designed to build emotional momentum systematically: the first question ("How is this different from everything else I've seen?") activates dopamine, while subsequent questions layer credibility, benefits, mechanism, and proof. Dan Kennedy identified seven core emotional triggers that recur across all markets, anchored by fear of loss and desire for gain. Gary Halbert focused research on "emotional turning points" — moments when prospects are most receptive because they've just experienced a major life change (new baby, divorce, bankruptcy, health scare). The research report maps which emotions are dominant in the market and which specific triggers will move the prospect to action.

**Pillar 7: Proof element assembly.** Bencivenga's Bullet #5 teaches that "the strongest proof wins." The research phase must catalog every available proof asset: testimonials, case studies, statistical data, expert endorsements, media mentions, certifications, before/after results, and demonstration evidence. Evaldo Albuquerque categorizes proof into four types — statistical, testimonial, authority/credential, and story-based (which he considers the strongest connector). Adele Revella's Buyer Persona framework surfaces proof needs through the "Buyer's Journey" ring, which reveals who and what influences the buyer and what sources they trust. The research report should contain a dedicated proof inventory organized by type and strength.

## How the modern agency research brief is structured

The most widely adopted formal framework in modern direct response is Stefan Georgi's RMBC Method (Research, Mechanism, Brief, Copy), used exclusively by VShred (which generated **$200M+ annually**) and taught in the Copy Accelerator Mastermind. Georgi's research phase uses **22 specific research questions** covering target demographic language patterns, pain points, past failed solutions, emotional triggers, key benefits, biggest objections, and competitive advantages. The process starts with a **10+ page copywriting brief** sent to the client, followed by independent research that produces a 30+ page research document.

At Copyhackers, Joanna Wiebe teaches a three-part conversion copywriting process where Research & Discovery is explicitly "the biggest part of the work — if it's not the biggest part, 99% of the time you're doing it wrong." Her seven core research techniques form a complete methodology:

- **Customer and stakeholder interviews** using science-based open-ended questioning, with the anchor question: "What was going on in your life that compelled you to come looking for a solution like ours?"
- **Surveys** identifying usage scenarios, unexpected results, objections, anxieties, and decision influencers
- **Review mining** across Amazon, Reddit, app stores, and competitor review sites, extracting exact customer language into categorized spreadsheets
- **Heatmaps and scrollmaps** using Hotjar to understand on-page behavior
- **Analytics deep-dives** to understand visitor intent based on traffic source
- **Competitor messaging teardowns** stripping messaging from competitor websites, emails, onboarding sequences, and ads
- **Session recordings** watching actual users navigate existing pages

The output of this research phase is what Wiebe calls the "messaging hierarchy" — an ordered sequence of messages that determines what appears first, second, and third in the copy, based entirely on what customers said matters most.

Harmon Brothers, known for viral direct response videos generating hundreds of millions in revenue, follows a different but research-intensive model. Their Phase 1 involves months of product immersion — the creative director must be genuinely "sold" on the product. Phase 2 assesses where the client sits on a timeline from startup to household brand, which determines whether creative leans conversion or brand. Their brain trust review process submits every script to a panel that identifies problems honestly. Their core test for a concept: it must be **Clear, Relevant, Emotional, and Interesting** simultaneously.

Golden Hippo, a billion-dollar DTC marketer, requires copywriters to "conduct extensive research on products, ingredients, customer avatars" with "intensive research experience using primary sources" listed as an explicit job requirement. Their copywriters must integrate market research, survey results, and scientific data into marketing copy while meeting monthly revenue goals tracked to individual writers.

## Academic frameworks that feed the direct response research machine

Three academic frameworks have been adopted directly into direct response practice. **Clayton Christensen's Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)** framework — which holds that customers "hire" products to accomplish functional, emotional, and social jobs — has been validated in A/B testing for ad copy. Two Octobers demonstrated that JTBD-based messaging outperformed standard feature-focused copy. The outcome statement formula ("When [situation], help me [job to be done], so I can [desired outcome]") generates headlines and value propositions directly from research interviews.

**Adele Revella's 5 Rings of Buying Insight** from the Buyer Persona Institute provides the most rigorous persona methodology. Her five rings — Priority Initiatives (what triggers buying), Success Factors (expected outcomes), Perceived Barriers (purchase blockers), Buyer's Journey (influences and process), and Decision Criteria (required product attributes) — require **30 interviews of 30 minutes each** as baseline research. Revella calls the output "almost like cheating" because it directly reveals what headlines to write, what benefits to emphasize, what objections to address, and what exact customer language to use.

**Dave Gray's Empathy Map Canvas** provides a rapid research synthesis tool. Its four quadrants — Says (verbatim quotes), Thinks (beliefs and internal narrative), Does (observable behaviors), and Feels (emotional states) — can produce a rough map in 20 minutes or a comprehensive version in a half-day workshop. The "Says" quadrant feeds directly into headline language, "Thinks/Feels" reveals emotional triggers, and "Pains" maps to objections that copy must overcome.

## CRO research frameworks that complete the picture

Peep Laja's **ResearchXL framework** from CXL represents the conversion optimization gold standard, built on the principle that CRO is "80% research and 20% experimentation." Its six sequential steps — technical analysis (cross-browser/device testing), heuristic analysis (evaluating clarity, relevance, friction, and distraction), digital analytics deep-dive, mouse tracking and heatmaps, qualitative research (surveys, interviews, user testing), and formal user testing — produce an output categorized into four action buckets: Test (big conversion opportunities), Instrument (tracking fixes), Hypothesize (known problems needing solution brainstorming), and Just Do It (no-brainer fixes).

**MECLABS' patented Conversion Sequence Heuristic** — C = 4m + 3v + 2(i-f) - 2a — assigns weighted importance to five factors: Motivation (weight 4, the highest — and crucially, you cannot create it, only understand and channel it), Value Proposition (weight 3), Incentive (weight 2), minus Friction (weight 2) and Anxiety (weight 2). The formula's weighting reveals a critical insight for research: understanding customer motivation is literally twice as important as reducing friction. This is why voice-of-customer research dominates every serious direct response research process.

Chris Goward's **LIFT Model** evaluates pages across six conversion factors — value proposition (center), clarity, relevance, and urgency (drivers upward), anxiety and distraction (inhibitors dragging down) — using an airplane metaphor where the value proposition is the aircraft body. His **PIE prioritization framework** (Potential × Importance × Ease) determines which test hypotheses to pursue first, preventing teams from wasting resources on low-impact optimizations.

Peep Laja's newer venture, **Wynter**, tests messaging across five dimensions — clarity, relevance, value, differentiation, and brand perception — using panels of validated B2B professionals. Their research shows that **12–13 responses reach qualitative saturation**, meaning the same themes emerge whether you survey 13 or 130 people. This challenges the assumption that large sample sizes are always necessary for copywriting research.

## The complete research report anatomy, component by component

Synthesizing all frameworks studied, the definitive direct response market research report contains these sections, presented in the order practitioners typically complete them:

**Market and awareness classification** establishes the strategic foundation. It answers: Where does the prospect sit on Schwartz's five awareness levels? What is the market sophistication level? What has already been said and promised by competitors? This section determines the entire copy architecture — a Problem Aware audience needs empathy and education before any product mention, while a Most Aware audience just needs an irresistible deal. Todd Brown's A.S.I.S.T. process makes this the mandatory first step.

**Prospect deep profile** builds the psychological portrait. It includes demographics, psychographics, goals, values, fears, frustrations, desires, current solutions being used, past failures, emotional turning points, information sources, and the triggering event that initiated their search. Carlton requires knowing what "id ticklers" will work (faster, easier, simpler, unfair advantage, inside info, bragging rights). Makepeace's 14 prospect questions probe overriding desires, objections, trust barriers, and what makes purchase feel mandatory. DigitalMarketer's "but no one else would" trick identifies niche media sources only the ideal customer would consume.

**Voice-of-customer data repository** is the raw material library. This section contains categorized verbatim quotes mined from Amazon reviews, Reddit threads, Facebook groups, Quora, support tickets, sales call transcripts, survey responses, and interview recordings. Organized into columns — pain points, desires/dreams, hesitations/anxieties, outcomes achieved, and language patterns — this repository provides the actual words and phrases that will appear in the final copy. Copyhackers recommends a minimum of **100 lines of quotes** before reaching saturation.

**Competitive intelligence dossier** catalogs what the market already sees. It documents competitors' primary promises, unique mechanisms (if any), offer structures (pricing, guarantees, bonuses), positioning statements, ad creative (sourced from Meta Ad Library and similar tools), funnel architecture, and claims already made. The strategic purpose is twofold: avoid the "mental opt-out" Todd Brown warns about, and identify gaps in competitor messaging that represent positioning opportunities.

**Product and mechanism analysis** extracts the unique selling architecture. This section answers Bencivenga's fundamental question — "What are we really selling?" — and identifies the unique mechanism that explains how and why the product delivers results differently than alternatives. Georgi's two-part mechanism framework documents both why the prospect's problem exists (and why other solutions failed) and why this specific solution is the only one that works. Makepeace's 10 product questions convert features to benefits using the "...that means..." bridge technique. Albuquerque's formula distills this to: the new opportunity, the prospect's desire, and the new mechanism.

**Emotional trigger inventory** maps the psychological levers available. Research identifies which positive emotions (hope, excitement, relief, pride, curiosity) and negative emotions (fear, frustration, shame, anger, envy) are dominant in the market, which specific triggers will be most effective given the awareness level, and which emotional turning points (Halbert's concept) the prospect is likely experiencing. Georgi marks these explicitly during his second reading pass of the research document.

**Proof and credibility asset inventory** catalogs every available proof element by type and strength. Statistical proof (data, studies, clinical trials), testimonial proof (customer stories, before/after), authority proof (expert endorsements, media mentions, credentials), and story-based proof (narrative demonstrations of results). This section ensures the writer has ammunition for every credibility challenge the prospect will raise, mapped to Albuquerque's sequential question #2 ("Why should I believe you?") and #5 ("Who else has done this?").

**Objection and anxiety register** anticipates every reason the prospect might not buy. Sourced from VOC mining, survey responses, and competitor review analysis, this section lists specific objections (price, skepticism, timing, alternatives) paired with available counter-evidence. Copyhackers frames these as "hesitations and anxieties." MECLABS weighs anxiety as a conversion inhibitor equal in magnitude to friction.

**Brief and messaging hierarchy** is the bridge between research and copy. Georgi's RMBC Brief phase takes all research findings and assembles them into a structured outline that answers every critical question — background story, product creation story, proof elements, and logical argument sequence. Copyhackers' messaging hierarchy orders messages by importance based on frequency and intensity in VOC data. When this document is complete, Georgi notes, "the copy almost writes itself."

## Conclusion: research is the product, copy is the packaging

The most striking finding across this research is not any single framework but the **unanimous agreement on a ratio**: the best direct response marketers allocate the majority of their project time to research, not writing. Bencivenga's 40% research allocation, Schwartz's four weeks of research before one week of writing, Georgi's 30+ page research documents, and Wiebe's declaration that research should be "the biggest part of the work" all point to the same conclusion. The copy that generates millions doesn't come from creative inspiration — it comes from systematic extraction of customer language, competitive gaps, and product mechanisms.

Three insights emerge that aren't obvious from any single framework. First, **the research report is itself a persuasion document** — when done properly, reading the research should make the writer feel the prospect's pain and desire so viscerally that the copy becomes an almost automatic response. Second, **the unique mechanism concept represents the single biggest evolution** in direct response research since Schwartz's original awareness framework. It explains why mediocre products with great mechanism stories outsell great products with generic positioning. Third, the convergence between CRO frameworks (ResearchXL, MECLABS, LIFT) and classic copywriting research (Schwartz, Bencivenga, Carlton) reveals that **conversion optimization and direct response copywriting are the same discipline** — one approached from a testing methodology, the other from a writing methodology, but both requiring identical customer research as their foundation.

The practitioners who consistently produce controls — the promotions that beat everything else and become the standard to beat — are not better writers. They are better researchers who happen to write.
