# Agent 1A — Foundation Research

*Generated: 2026-02-11 16:46 | Model: gpt-5.2 | Time: 133.2s*

---

Below is a practitioner-grade “Foundation Research” playbook you can turn directly into **Agent 1A’s system prompt + output schema**. It’s built to (1) diagnose **Awareness + Sophistication**, (2) extract **voice-of-customer** at scale, (3) map **desires/fears/objections** into creative directives, and (4) hand downstream agents **structured inputs** (ideas, hooks, claims, angles, offers, compliance flags, testing plan).

---

# 0) Agent 1A mandate (what “great” looks like)

**Agent 1A is not “insights.”** It produces **decision-ready constraints** for every downstream step:

- **WHO**: discrete customer segments (not 1 persona) + how to recognize them in the wild  
- **WHERE psychologically**: Schwartz awareness level + triggers that move them 1 step  
- **WHAT language**: verbatim phrases, metaphors, “I want…” statements, “I’m afraid…” statements  
- **HOW saturated**: Schwartz market sophistication stage + what claims/mechanisms will be believed  
- **HOW to win**: messaging white space + angle inventory + do/don’t list  
- **HOW to test**: hypotheses + measurement + creative test matrix  
- **HOW to stay safe**: compliance red-flags by category/platform (feeds Agent 12)

Agent 1A runs quarterly because it establishes the **stable “truth” layer**: category narratives, core JTBD, competitor archetypes, and the language map. Weekly/batch agents should only update deltas.

# 1) Customer research methodology — “best of the best” (how elite DR teams actually do it)

## 1.1 The “4-Lens Research Stack” (use this as Agent 1A’s master method)

Top performance shops converge on a stack like this:

### Lens A — **Voice of Customer (VoC)**
Goal: capture **verbatim** emotional + functional language.
Sources:
- reviews (Amazon/DTC), UGC comments, TikTok shop reviews
- Reddit, FB Groups, Discords
- customer support tickets, returns reasons, CS chat logs
- competitor ad comments (“this is a scam”, “does it work for X?”)

Outputs:
- language bank (exact phrases)
- top “before states” and “after states”
- objection taxonomy

### Lens B — **Behavioral Demand Signals**
Goal: see what people *do* not what they say.
Sources:
- search queries (Google autosuggest/keyword tools), Amazon autocomplete
- Meta Ad Library/TikTok Creative Center (themes, formats, offers)
- analytics: top landing page paths, on-site search, PDP FAQ clicks, refund reasons
Outputs:
- demand map by intent level
- angle-to-intent matching

### Lens C — **Market Structure & Competition**
Goal: define the “rules of belief” in the category.
Sources:
- top 10–30 spenders’ ads + landing pages + advertorials
- category claims inventory (“clinically proven”, “dermatologist recommended”, etc.)
Outputs:
- market sophistication stage
- mechanism saturation score
- messaging white space

### Lens D — **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)**
Goal: identify the real job (progress) and switching triggers.
Sources:
- interviews, long reviews, Reddit “I finally tried…” posts
Outputs:
- job statement, context, switching forces, anxieties, habits
- “moment of purchase” storyline

**Agent 1A should always output all four lenses**; downstream agents will pull different slices.

## 1.2 Eugene Schwartz — 5 Levels of Awareness (full framework → ad approach → how to identify)

Schwartz’s point is practical: **your headline (and opening) must start where the prospect already is** and move them forward one step. Many modern summaries get this right: awareness levels dictate what you can credibly say first, especially in short-form paid social. ([blogsthatsell.com](https://blogsthatsell.com/blog/breakthrough-advertising-what-people-get-wrong/?utm_source=openai))

### Level 5 — **Most Aware**
**They know your product, they want it, they’re just waiting on the deal.**
- **Creative job:** remove friction; trigger purchase now.
- **Primary levers:** offer, urgency, guarantee, bundles, shipping, checkout ease.
- **Headline/opening strategy:** *deal-first* (“Ends tonight”, “Bonus included”, “Restock”).
- **How to identify:**
  - retargeting pools: ATC/IC, repeat visitors, email clickers
  - comments like “is this back in stock?”, “does it come in X?”, “promo code?”
- **What moves them:** price/bonus/availability.

### Level 4 — **Product Aware**
**They know you, not convinced / comparing / procrastinating.**
- **Creative job:** prove + de-risk.
- **Primary levers:** proof, specificity, comparisons, demonstrations, risk reversal.
- **Headline/opening strategy:** *proof-first* (“Why 10,000 switched…”, “Watch it work…”). ([blogsthatsell.com](https://blogsthatsell.com/blog/breakthrough-advertising-what-people-get-wrong/?utm_source=openai))
- **How to identify:**
  - branded search
  - ad comments: “does it work for X?”, “is it worth it?”, “how long does it last?”
  - bounce on PDP FAQ / shipping / returns
- **What moves them:** credible evidence + “why us” differentiation + guarantees.

### Level 3 — **Solution Aware**
**They know solutions exist, don’t know you (or don’t see why you’re different).**
- **Creative job:** introduce your **mechanism** (why/how it works) and why it’s better.
- **Primary levers:** unique mechanism, comparison to common alternatives, “new way”.
- **Headline/opening strategy:** *mechanism-first* (“A new way to…”, “Unlike X, this…”). ([blogsthatsell.com](https://blogsthatsell.com/blog/breakthrough-advertising-what-people-get-wrong/?utm_source=openai))
- **How to identify:**
  - searches like “best ___ for ___”
  - viewers watching demos/comparison content
  - comments: “how is this different than [brand]?”
- **What moves them:** “why this solution” + “why this mechanism”.

### Level 2 — **Problem Aware**
**They feel the pain; may not know solutions exist / skeptical that anything works.**
- **Creative job:** agitate and name the problem vividly; then pivot to possibility.
- **Primary levers:** empathy, symptom storytelling, cost of inaction, “this is why it keeps happening”.
- **Headline/opening strategy:** *problem-first* (“Tired of…?”, “If you struggle with…”). ([blogsthatsell.com](https://blogsthatsell.com/blog/breakthrough-advertising-what-people-get-wrong/?utm_source=openai))
- **How to identify:**
  - searches like “why do I…”, “how to fix…”
  - long-form complaint posts and “anyone else?” threads
- **What moves them:** recognition + hope + “here’s what’s actually causing it.”

### Level 1 — **Unaware**
**They aren’t thinking about the problem; may not admit it; desire is general.**
- **Creative job:** earn attention without “selling”; create curiosity/identification.
- **Primary levers:** story, pattern interrupt, contrarian truth, identity/culture.
- **Headline/opening strategy:** *curiosity/identity-first* (opens on a situation, not a product). ([blogsthatsell.com](https://blogsthatsell.com/blog/breakthrough-advertising-what-people-get-wrong/?utm_source=openai))
- **How to identify:**
  - broad interest targeting; low intent behaviors
  - “I didn’t know this was a thing” comments
- **What moves them:** intrigue → self-diagnosis → “maybe this is me.”

#### The operational rule (turn into logic):
**You identify awareness level by what the customer can say unaided.**
- If they can name your product: Product/Most aware.
- If they can name alternatives: Solution aware.
- If they can only name symptoms/pain: Problem aware.
- If they can’t name the pain but resonates with a story: Unaware.

Agent 1A should output a **classification rubric** (examples of phrases per level) so downstream agents can tag creative variants correctly.

## 1.3 Eugene Schwartz — Market Sophistication Stages (1–5) and what it changes in practice

Market sophistication describes **how many claims the market has already heard** and what they’ll still believe. In saturated DTC categories you’re usually in later stages, where **claims alone don’t work**; you need mechanism, proof, and/or new framing. ([linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williamkast_the-5-market-sophistication-stages-by-eugene-activity-7409609626213625856-8afj?utm_source=openai))

### Stage 1 — First claim wins
- Messaging: simple benefit claim (“Lose weight”).
- Creative: direct benefit, little proof required.

### Stage 2 — Claims intensify
- Messaging: bigger, faster, more specific (“Lose 20 lbs in 4 weeks”).
- Creative: bold promise + early proof.

### Stage 3 — Claims become unbelievable → **mechanism becomes the differentiator**
- Messaging: introduce a **new mechanism** that “makes the claim make sense.”
- Creative: “why it works” + demonstration + credibility.

### Stage 4 — Mechanisms get copied → mechanism alone isn’t enough
- Messaging: refine mechanism + add **proof**, **process**, **identity**, or **new promise structure**.
- Creative: proof stacks, third-party validation, comparison tests, “how to use”.

### Stage 5 — Market is numb
- Messaging: **reframe** the desire/problem, or position against category norms.
- Creative: new worldview, contrarian angle, identity-based belonging, “the enemy”, category disruption.

#### How to diagnose sophistication (Agent 1A checklist)
Collect 50–200 competitor ads + LPs; score these:

1) **Claim similarity**: are they all promising the same end benefit?
2) **Mechanism repetition**: do they all use the same “because”?
3) **Proof inflation**: heavy reliance on reviews, “clinically proven”, badges?
4) **Audience cynicism**: comments like “scam”, “another one of these”
5) **Creative sameness**: identical UGC scripts, same hooks, same edits

Then output:
- **Sophistication Stage (1–5)**
- **Mechanism Saturation Map** (which mechanisms are overused)
- **Believability Requirements** (what proof is table stakes now)

## 1.4 Ryan Levesque — Ask Method applied to ad creative research (surveys that unlock “why”)

The Ask Method’s value for creative: it gives you **segment-driven language** and a way to convert qualitative into **buckets you can target with angles** (and later: dynamic creative). Summaries consistently describe the flow: deep dive survey → bucketing → micro-commitment bridge quiz. ([leaderself.com](https://www.leaderself.com/summary/ask-ryan-levesque/?utm_source=openai))

### Use it like this (practical for paid social):
**Quarterly Deep Dive Survey (DDS)** to build your segment & language map. Then build:
- **Angle libraries by bucket**
- **Hook libraries by bucket**
- **Objection priorities by bucket**
- **Offer framing by bucket**

#### DDS structure (the “sandwich” logic)
You want:
- easy open → deep emotional middle → practical close

**High-yield DDS questions (copy/paste into Agent 1A):**
1) “What was happening in your life that made you start looking for a solution?”  
2) “What have you tried before? What did you like/dislike about it?”  
3) “What’s the #1 thing you’re hoping this will help you achieve?”  
4) “What worries you most about trying something new?”  
5) “If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different in 30 days?”  
6) “What would make you say ‘this isn’t for me’?”  
7) “What words would you use to describe how this problem feels?”  
8) “Who else is affected when this problem shows up?”  
9) “What’s stopped you from solving this so far?”  
10) “Anything else you want us to know?” (gold hides here)

**Bucketing outputs:**
- 3–7 buckets max (enough for differentiation, not too many to act on)
- each bucket gets:
  - dominant desired outcome
  - dominant fear
  - dominant objection
  - awareness level distribution
  - best starting hook types

### Micro-Commitment Bridge (MCB) for ongoing acquisition
Ask Method logic: a short quiz segments new leads. This gives you:
- better TOF relevance
- better retargeting messages

Agent 1A should output: **recommended quiz questions** aligned to discovered buckets.

## 1.5 How top agencies do audience research (what to emulate in an AI agent)

### VaynerMedia style: **active listening + cultural intelligence → daily briefs**
Public-facing materials and job descriptions make it clear their strategy roles emphasize:
- continuous monitoring of brand channels, comments, DMs
- social listening across communities
- daily digests that translate observations into briefs/recommendations ([startup.jobs](https://startup.jobs/post-creative-strategist-vaynermedia-6982512?utm_source=openai))

**What to copy for Agent 1A (quarterly version):**
- “community voice” section: what people are *already* saying + what they’re fighting about
- “culture hooks” list: trends/memes/creator formats relevant to category
- “attention realities” constraints: what will get watched in this niche

### Ogilvy style (classic): **brief discipline**
Ogilvy is historically obsessive about the **brief** being the operating system for creative teams. Their public content emphasizes the importance of the brief as a strategic artifact. ([ogilvy.com](https://www.ogilvy.com/ideas/most-important-brief-harnessing-creativity-address-climate-change?utm_source=openai))

**What to copy:**
- single-minded proposition (SMP)
- supporting evidence
- tone/brand personality
- mandatories + exclusions

### Performance shops (CTC/Pilothouse/Raindrop): “creative as a system”
Public pages are light on method details, but the consistent theme is:
- creative volume + structured iteration
- creative tied to business outcomes
- “from idea conception to execution” integration (Pilothouse positioning) ([pilothouse.co](https://www.pilothouse.co/?utm_source=openai))

**What to copy:**
- research must output **testable angles** and **iteration rules**, not just “insights”

---

## 1.6 Review mining methodology (how elite copywriters extract “gold”)

### The “5-Bucket VoC Coding System” (make this mandatory)
Every mined snippet must be tagged as one of:

1) **Moment/Trigger** (what happened right before buying)
2) **Desired outcome** (what “better” looks like)
3) **Pain / frustration** (why status quo sucks)
4) **Objection / fear** (why they hesitate)
5) **Proof / delight** (what convinced them; what surprised them)

Additionally tag:
- intensity (1–5)
- specificity (generic ↔ concrete)
- persona signals (life stage, identity, usage context)
- awareness level (inferred)

### What patterns great miners look for
- **“Before” language:** shame, overwhelm, confusion, time pressure
- **“After” language:** relief, control, identity upgrade (“I’m finally the kind of person who…”)
- **Comparison statements:** “I tried X and Y…”
- **Quantified outcomes:** timelines, frequency, usage
- **Mechanism beliefs:** folk theories (“my hormones…”, “it’s because of stress…”)
- **Failure modes:** “it worked until…”, “it made it worse because…”

### How to organize verbatim language
Agent 1A should output:
- a **Verbatim Library** (table)
- plus a **Messaging Dictionary**:
  - “customer word” → “our translation” → “creative applications”
Example:
- “I feel puffy” → water retention / inflammation framing → hook: “Why you wake up puffy…”

---

## 1.7 JTBD applied to ad creative (why it improves concepts)

JTBD forces you to stop selling features and instead sell **progress in a specific situation**.

### JTBD core output formats (Agent 1A should generate both)
1) **Job statement:**  
“When I’m in [situation], I want to [make progress], so I can [desired outcome], despite [constraints].”

2) **Forces of progress (for messaging)**
- Push (pain of old way)
- Pull (attraction to new way)
- Anxiety (fear of switching)
- Habit (inertia/comfort)

**Creative payoff:** you can write hooks that start with the situation (TOF), then present mechanism/proof (MOF/BOF), and pre-handle anxieties.

---

## 1.8 Customer interview methodology (questions that produce ad angles, not “nice chats”)

Your goal is to elicit:
- the **moment of realization**
- the **decision criteria**
- the **language they used internally**
- what “almost stopped them”
- what “sealed the deal”

### The best interview flow (Agent 1A script)
**A) Context & trigger**
- “What was happening in your life when you decided to look for a solution?”
- “What changed that made it feel urgent *now*?”
- “What would have happened if you did nothing?”

**B) Prior attempts & skepticism**
- “What had you tried before? What disappointed you?”
- “What did you assume would happen if you tried another solution?”

**C) Evaluation & decision**
- “Walk me through the exact steps from ‘maybe’ to ‘bought’.”
- “What were you comparing us against (including doing nothing)?”
- “What was your #1 concern right before you purchased?”

**D) First use & outcome**
- “What did you notice first?”
- “What surprised you?”
- “How long until you felt confident it was working?”

**E) Identity & social dimension**
- “Who did you tell? Who would you never tell?”
- “What does solving this mean about you?”

**F) Messaging extraction**
- “If you were recommending this to a friend, what would you say?”
- “What would you warn them about?”
- “What would you *not* want an ad to sound like?”

Agent 1A should turn transcripts into:
- hook prompts (situational openers)
- claim prompts (specific outcomes)
- objection scripts (exact hesitations)

---

# 2) Desire, fear, and objection mapping (systematize it like DR teams)

## 2.1 Operationalize Schwartz: “copy can’t create desire; only channel it”
In practice, this means your creative must anchor in **pre-existing demand vectors**:

### Demand vectors (Agent 1A must identify 3–10)
- status/identity
- health/safety
- convenience/time
- belonging/attractiveness
- relief from anxiety
- control/mastery
- saving money/avoiding waste
- moral/values alignment

Then: **map each vector to product-specific proof + mechanism.**

---

## 2.2 The “Desire Stack” (how to find the ONE core desire)
Most products have many wants; winners pick one **dominant promise** per segment.

Agent 1A should score each candidate desire on:
1) **Intensity** (how emotional)
2) **Frequency** (how common in VoC)
3) **Immediacy** (how urgent now)
4) **Believability** (given sophistication)
5) **Uniqueness** (white space vs competitors)
6) **Profitability** (AOV/LTV alignment)

Output:
- ranked desires by segment
- “core desire” recommendation + 2 alternates

---

## 2.3 Objection taxonomy (paid social specific)
Agent 1A should generate objections in these categories:

1) **Efficacy**: “Will it work for me?”
2) **Mechanism skepticism**: “How can that possibly…?”
3) **Risk**: side effects, return hassle, data/privacy
4) **Time**: “How long until results?”
5) **Effort**: “Do I have to change my routine?”
6) **Price/value**: “Too expensive for what it is”
7) **Trust**: “Is this a scam? fake reviews?”
8) **Fit**: compatibility, skin type, body type, lifestyle, values
9) **Complexity**: “I’m overwhelmed; I don’t want another program”

For each objection, Agent 1A must output:
- verbatim examples
- best proof type (demo, testimonial, third-party, guarantee)
- best creative format (UGC, explainer, comparison, founder story)
- “handle lines” (copy fragments that address it)

---

# 3) Competitive positioning analysis (creative strategy version)

## 3.1 Porter's frameworks — translated into messaging “white space”
Instead of strategy decks, use this output:

### A) Competitive claim map
Create a table of competitors vs:
- primary promise (end benefit)
- mechanism (the “because”)
- proof style (reviews, science, authority)
- offer style (trial, bundle, subscription)
- identity/tone (snarky, clinical, luxury, eco)
- target awareness (inferred)
- sophistication approach (claim vs mechanism vs reframe)

### B) Messaging white space identification
White space usually appears in one of these gaps:
1) **Unclaimed mechanism** (a believable “because” nobody owns)
2) **Under-served segment** (a “for people who…” slice)
3) **Different success metric** (not “weight loss” but “energy at 3pm”)
4) **Different enemy** (blame a hidden cause)
5) **Different proof** (visual demo vs badge soup)
6) **Different tone** (humor vs clinical) in a category monoculture

Agent 1A should output 5–15 white-space hypotheses with:
- why it’s white space (evidence from competitor patterns)
- risks (compliance, believability)
- best awareness stage to deploy it

---

## 3.2 Analyze competitor awareness + sophistication targeting (how to infer)
**Awareness targeting signals:**
- “Sale ends” / “free shipping” = Most aware
- heavy testimonials + guarantee = Product aware
- “new way to…” + mechanism explainer = Solution aware
- symptom agitation = Problem aware
- story/curiosity with delayed reveal = Unaware ([blogsthatsell.com](https://blogsthatsell.com/blog/breakthrough-advertising-what-people-get-wrong/?utm_source=openai))

**Sophistication targeting signals:**
- Stage 1–2: simple/bigger claims; little mechanism
- Stage 3: “because of [new mechanism]”
- Stage 4: mechanism + proof stack arms race
- Stage 5: reframe/contrarian worldview

Agent 1A should label each competitor with:
- primary awareness level targeted
- sophistication response strategy
- “creative sameness cluster” (what they all copy)

---

# 4) Output structure — what the ideal research brief looks like (for creatives + buyers + compliance)

Below is a **ready-to-implement schema** for Agent 1A. It’s designed so Agent 2/4/5 can pull angles/hooks mechanically, and Agent 12 can flag risks.

## 4.1 Foundation Research Brief (recommended structure)

### Section 1 — Category snapshot
- Category definition + substitutes (“doing nothing”, “DIY”, “professional service”)
- Seasonality & buying windows
- Typical AOV/LTV expectations (if known)
- Channel truth: what formats dominate (UGC, demos, founder)

### Section 2 — Segmentation (3–7 buckets)
For each bucket:
- name (human-readable)
- “when I’m…” situation (JTBD context)
- core desire (ranked)
- core fear
- top 5 objections
- awareness distribution (Unaware → Most aware)
- top triggers (events that create urgency)
- best offer framing (trial/bundle/subscription)
- compliance sensitivities (medical claims, personal attributes, etc.)

### Section 3 — Schwartz Awareness playbook (per bucket)
For each awareness level:
- opening line types (hooks)
- headline patterns
- what you can/can’t say first
- “move them one step” bridge sentence

### Section 4 — Market Sophistication diagnosis
- stage (1–5) with evidence
- mechanism saturation map
- claim inflation notes
- “what will be believed now” rules
- recommended differentiation approach (new mechanism vs proof vs reframe)

### Section 5 — VoC Language Bank (verbatim)
Tables:
- pains/frustrations (verbatim)
- desires (verbatim)
- skepticism/objections (verbatim)
- proof moments (“this is when I knew…”)
- metaphors and identity lines

Tag each row with:
- bucket
- awareness level
- emotional intensity score
- suggested creative use (hook / body / CTA / caption)

### Section 6 — Competitive messaging map
- top competitors (10–30)
- their promise/mechanism/proof/offer/tone
- awareness/sophistication targeting inference
- creative clusters + gaps

### Section 7 — Angle inventory (the handoff gold)
Create 20–60 angles, each with:
- angle name
- target bucket + awareness level
- desired emotion (relief, pride, disgust, hope)
- hook templates (3–5)
- claim template (with placeholders)
- proof type required
- recommended format (UGC, demo, founder, comparison, explainer)
- compliance risk rating (low/med/high) + notes

### Section 8 — Testing plan (feeds media buyer + scaling agent)
- test matrix: angles × hooks × formats
- prioritization (ICE score or similar)
- guardrails: frequency, creative fatigue indicators
- expected leading indicators (thumbstop, hold rate, CTR) and lagging (CPA, MER)

### Section 9 — Compliance pre-brief (feeds Agent 12)
- prohibited claim areas likely to arise in category
- “safe phrasing” patterns
- disallowed personal-attribute callouts risk
- before/after guidelines and disclaimers needed

---

# 5) Building Agent 1A: practical implementation notes (so it works as an autonomous quarterly agent)

## 5.1 Inputs Agent 1A should require
Minimum:
- product offer + pricing + margins
- top 3 winning creatives (if any)
- landing page + PDP + FAQ + email flows
- target geos + shipping constraints
- known compliance restrictions (e.g., supplements, financial)

Optional but powerful:
- export of reviews + CS tickets + refunds
- competitor list
- Meta Ad Library IDs

## 5.2 “Always-on” internal scoring models Agent 1A should maintain
- **Awareness classifier** (rule-based + LLM)
- **Sophistication scorer** (based on competitor corpus similarity)
- **Objection frequency index** (count per 1,000 VoC lines)
- **Language uniqueness index** (how distinctive your phrasing is vs category)

## 5.3 Outputs as structured objects (for agent chaining)
Return as JSON (or strict YAML) with stable keys:
- `segments[]`
- `awareness_playbook{}`
- `sophistication_diagnosis{}`
- `voc_library[]`
- `competitor_map[]`
- `angle_inventory[]`
- `testing_plan{}`
- `compliance_prebrief{}`

---

## 6) What I’d change in your pipeline (small but important)
You listed “Phase 5 — QA & Launch: Agent 11, 12, 14” but **Agent 13 is missing**; if intentional, ignore. If not intentional, a strong missing role is:

**Agent 13 — Measurement & Attribution Setup QA**
- verifies pixel/CAPI, event prioritization, AEM, UTMs, naming conventions
- ensures tests are analyzable before launch

This matters because Agent 15A/15B scaling will otherwise learn from noisy data.

---

If you want, I can now convert everything above into:
1) a **System Prompt** for Agent 1A (with tool-use instructions, guardrails, and scoring rubrics), and  
2) a **full JSON schema** for the quarterly research brief (so Agents 2/4/5/12 can consume it deterministically).
