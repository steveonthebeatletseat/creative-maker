# Agent 04 — Copywriter

*Generated: 2026-02-11 16:46 | Model: gpt-5.2 | Time: 123.7s*

---

Below is a practitioner-grade research + design spec for **Agent 4 (Copywriter)**: how it should think, what it should output, and the exact frameworks / pacing rules that make scripts convert in **15–60s paid social**.

---

## 0) The job of Agent 4 (in your pipeline)

**Inputs it should assume it has**
- **Approved concept brief** (angle, target persona, product, offer, mechanism, proof assets, objections, compliance constraints) from Agent 3.
- **Customer language bank** (verbatim VOC: pains, desires, “I tried X and it didn’t work because…”, phrasing, slang, objections) from Agent 1A.
- **Competitive intel** (dominant claims, common hooks, saturated promises) from Agent 1B.

**Outputs it must produce**
- Production-ready scripts that:
  1) **Choose the right persuasion structure** (awareness-level matched)
  2) **Make one core promise/mechanism legible in <30s**
  3) **Sound like a human** (UGC-natural cadence)
  4) Provide **editor-ready** timing + on-screen text + scene notes
- Then pass cleanly to **Agent 5 (Hook Specialist)**, who will re-engineer the first 3 seconds.

**Agent 4’s core constraint**
- In paid social, you don’t “write ads.” You write:
  - a **scroll-stopper premise**
  - a **credible reason-to-believe**
  - a **single, easy next step**
  - in a format that can survive **sound-off** and **fast-scrolling**

# 1) Direct-response masters → what to steal for 15–30s social

## 1.1 Eugene Schwartz (Breakthrough Advertising) → “channel existing desire” + sophistication
**Key principles to operationalize**
1) **You don’t create desire, you channel it.**  
   Your script must enter the conversation already happening in the prospect’s head (VOC bank is your map).
2) **Awareness levels** decide *how much you explain* vs *how hard you push*. (More in section 4.)
3) **Market sophistication** decides *what kind of claim will be believed*. As markets mature, raw claims stop working and you must:
   - differentiate,
   - introduce a mechanism,
   - or shift into identity/emotion.  
   The well-known “5 stages of market sophistication” summary is widely taught (claim → amplified claim → differentiation → mechanism → identity). ([sorinadumitru.com](https://sorinadumitru.com/breakthrough-advertising-by-eugene-schwartz/?utm_source=openai))

**How this maps to 15–30s**
- **15s = one desire + one lever.**  
  Example: “I want whiter teeth” + “without sensitivity” + “in 7 days.”
- Sophisticated markets (skincare, weight loss, biz-op, supplements) often require a **named mechanism** even in short ads:
  - “Not another collagen… it’s *X-peptide delivery* that…”
- Your “Big Idea” is often a **mechanism reframed as a new belief**:
  - Old belief: “I need more willpower.”
  - New belief: “My environment / tool / mechanism is the bottleneck.”

**Agent 4 rule**
- Every script must explicitly declare:
  - **Dominant Desire**
  - **Primary Objection**
  - **Believability Device** (mechanism / proof / demo / “deadly sincerity”)

---

## 1.2 Gary Halbert → “letter writing” as direct address (even on video)
Halbert’s “magic” wasn’t prettiness; it was:
- **specific, concrete curiosity**
- **you-focused empathy**
- **simple, relentless readability**
- and a vibe of: *“I’m talking to you, not an audience.”*

**Translate to UGC**
- Write like a DM voice note, not a brand ad.
- Use **micro-commitments**: “Quick question…” / “If you’re dealing with X, watch this.”
- Halbert-esque specificity: numbers, time, location, constraint.
- Halbert pacing: short lines, one thought per sentence.

**Agent 4 rule**
- Script must pass a “voice note test”: if read aloud, it should sound like a friend explaining something fast.

---

## 1.3 David Ogilvy → headline dominance + research + specificity
Ogilvy’s enduring DR-relevant points:
- The “headline” carries most of the value; he’s famously quoted: “On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy…” ([goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/25181.David_Ogilvy?utm_source=openai))
- Be **informative**, not clever.
- Use **research** and **proof**; he’s also known for testing emphasis (“Never stop testing…” is commonly attributed to him). ([envision-creative.com](https://www.envision-creative.com/blog/david-ogilvy-advertising-lessons/?utm_source=openai))

**Translate to paid social**
- Your “headline” is:
  - the **first spoken line**
  - the **first on-screen text**
  - the **first visual**
- Ogilvy-style = “pure information hook”:
  - “At 60 mph the loudest noise…” becomes:
  - “My under-eye concealer didn’t crease after 9 hours.”

**Agent 4 rule**
- Every script includes an Ogilvy-ish **informational claim** *or* a **measurable demo** within the first 8–12 seconds (unless Unaware).

---

## 1.4 Gary Bencivenga → bullets as curiosity machines + “credibility engineering”
Bencivenga is famous for:
- “Bullets” that are really **fascinations** (curiosity + benefit tease).
- Heavy attention to **belief**: promises that feel safe because proof/authority/guarantee reduces risk.
- He also taught a “credos/values” approach to bonding (sell your values first). ([scottmartincopywriter.com](https://www.scottmartincopywriter.com/gary-bencivenga-interview?utm_source=openai))

**Translate to 15–30s**
- Convert “bullets” into **rapid-fire on-screen text beats**:
  - “Stops X”
  - “Fixes Y”
  - “In Z minutes”
  - “Even if you’ve tried A/B/C”
- And/or use **stacked micro-payoffs** every 2–3 seconds to prevent drop-off.

**Agent 4 rule**
- For any script >20s, include at least **3 fascination beats** (curiosity-open loops) that are resolved later in the script.

---

## 1.5 Stefan Georgi → RMBC + unique mechanism discipline
Stefan’s RMBC is explicitly: **Research, Mechanism, Brief, Copy**. ([stefanpaulgeorgi.com](https://www.stefanpaulgeorgi.com/blog/a-big-secret-about-how-i-write-copy/?utm_source=openai))  
Even if the pipeline already did research, Agent 4 should use RMBC logic as a *structure check*:

- **Research**: VOC + objections + competitors
- **Mechanism**: why old solutions fail + why this works
- **Brief**: assemble components (promise, proof, offer, CTA, scenes)
- **Copy**: write the actual lines

**Short-form translation**
- You can’t “explain” mechanisms—you **signal** them:
  - name it,
  - show it,
  - give one sentence of “why it’s different,”
  - then move.

**Agent 4 rule**
- Every script must have a **Mechanism Line** (spoken + optionally on-screen), even if it’s light:
  - “It’s not a stronger detergent—it’s an enzyme that breaks down…”

---

## 1.6 Justin Goff → “easy mechanism hook”
Goff’s “easy mechanism” hook is a repeatable pattern: small effort / simple action implies big outcome (“just X pages…”, “12 practice balls…”, “3-word text…”). ([justingoff.com](https://www.justingoff.com/the-easiest-and-most-irresistible-hook-you-can-use-in-emails-ads/?utm_source=openai))

**Translate to social**
- Make the effort feel tiny:
  - “One 30-second habit…”
  - “Two clicks in the app…”
  - “This one setting…”

**Agent 4 rule**
- If the concept allows it, embed **effort minimization** (“just / only / in 60 seconds / one step”) *but* pair it with proof to avoid scam vibe.

---

## 1.7 Evaldo Albuquerque → “Big Idea” + ultra-compressed promise logic
The “16-word sales letter” school is about compressing to a single line that carries:
- who it’s for,
- what it does,
- why it’s different,
- what to do next.

(There are many third-party summaries; you’ll likely train the agent from your internal distilled version rather than relying on public paraphrases.) ([dannybooboo.com](https://dannybooboo.com/books/16-word-sales-letter-book-review-notes-summary-evaldo-albuquerque/?utm_source=openai))

**Translate to UGC**
- Start your script by writing the “16-word spine” first (internal step), then expand into scenes.

---

## 1.8 Claude Hopkins → “reason-why” + measurement mindset
Hopkins’ lasting relevance:
- **Reason-why advertising**: give the prospect a *cause* to believe.
- **Test and measure** relentlessly (split testing culture is central in Scientific Advertising history). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Advertising?utm_source=openai))

**Translate to short-form**
- Your “reason why” can be a:
  - mechanism
  - demo
  - customer result
  - authority cue
  - guarantee cue

**Agent 4 rule**
- No claim without a “reason why” support line (even if short).

---

# 2) Short-form video copy frameworks (and when Agent 4 should choose each)

Below are the **core frameworks**, plus the practical “when to use” decision rules for paid social.

## 2.1 PAS (Problem–Agitation–Solution)
**Best for:** Problem-aware cold audiences, high pain, visceral frustrations.  
**Structure (15–30s)**
- Problem (0–3s): name the pain in VOC language.
- Agitate (3–8s): consequences + failed attempts.
- Solution (8–20s): mechanism + proof.
- CTA (last 3–5s): “Get X / Try Y / See if you qualify”

**UGC example skeleton**
- “If you’re dealing with [pain]…”
- “I tried [common fixes] and it still [bad outcome]…”
- “Then I found [product]—it uses [mechanism] so [reason why]…”
- “I noticed [specific result] in [time]…”
- “If you want [outcome], click and [CTA].”

## 2.2 AIDA adapted for 15–30s
Classic AIDA becomes:
- **A (0–2s)**: pattern interrupt claim / question
- **I (2–8s)**: what this is + for whom
- **D (8–22s)**: proof + benefit + mechanism
- **A (22–30s)**: single next step + urgency/guarantee

**Best for:** Product-aware → most-aware, or when you already have scroll-stopping visuals (demo product, before/after).

## 2.3 BAB (Before–After–Bridge)
**Best for:** transformation, testimonials, “day in the life,” beauty/fitness/home, SaaS productivity.  
- Before: “I used to…”
- After: “Now…”
- Bridge: “Here’s what changed (mechanism) + how to start”

## 2.4 Star–Story–Solution (UGC-native)
**Best for:** Unaware → problem-aware when you need to *earn attention* via narrative.  
- Star: “I’m a [identity] and I had [relatable issue]…”
- Story: 2–3 beats of struggle + discovery
- Solution: product + mechanism + proof + CTA

**Important:** in paid social, the “story” must still pay off every 2–4 seconds with new information.

## 2.5 The Big Idea (unifying idea)
This isn’t a “script format”; it’s the **force multiplier**:
- Hook, mechanism line, proof, visuals, CTA all reinforce the same core belief shift.

**Agent 4 implementation**
- Add a field to every script:
  - `BIG_IDEA: <one sentence belief shift>`
- Enforce consistency checks:
  - Does every line support the Big Idea?
  - If not, cut.

## 2.6 4 U’s for hooks/headlines (Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific, Useful)
Use this as a scoring rubric for:
- first spoken line
- first on-screen text
- thumbnail/poster frame

## 2.7 RMBC (as an execution framework)
Already covered above; for Agent 4 it functions as:
- a completeness checklist,
- and a mechanism discipline tool.

## 2.8 Additional short-form frameworks top buyers use (practitioner patterns)
These show up constantly in winning social:
1) **Claim → Proof → Offer**
   - “X happened” → “here’s the demo/result” → “get it”
2) **Myth → Truth → Fix**
   - “Stop doing A” → “do B because mechanism” → CTA
3) **Objection-first**
   - “I thought it was a scam / too expensive / wouldn’t work for me…” → proof → CTA
4) **3-Beat Demo**
   - show problem → show use → show measurable outcome
5) **Negative reverse**
   - “Don’t buy this if…” (qualification) → builds trust → CTA for the right person

---

# 3) UGC script structure + pacing (15s / 30s / 60s)

## 3.1 Pacing benchmarks (spoken + on-screen)
### Spoken words (voice)
- Conversational comfort is often cited around **150–160 WPM** (≈2.5–2.7 words/sec). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute?utm_source=openai))  
**Practical UGC ranges**
- **15s ad:** ~35–45 words (tight, punchy, room for pauses)
- **30s ad:** ~70–90 words
- **60s ad:** ~140–170 words (but needs structure to hold retention)

### On-screen text overlays
TikTok’s official creative best practices recommend **5–10 words per second** for text overlays. ([ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/creative-best-practices?utm_source=openai))  
That’s a *display speed*, not a “words you should write” target. In practice, for readability:
- 3–7 words per overlay is common (and aligns with many agency heuristics)
- hold each overlay ~0.6–1.2s depending on complexity

### Subtitle speed (reading)
Fast subtitle speeds reduce comprehension; research on subtitle speed shows comprehension declines as speed increases (measured at 12/20/28 characters per second). ([cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/applied-psycholinguistics/article/why-subtitle-speed-matters-evidence-from-word-skipping-and-rereading/A7DB0CBF5910353143738CF9C1721317?utm_source=openai))  
**Implication for Agent 4:** keep sentences short; don’t stack dense clauses.

---

## 3.2 Scene duration rules (editor-friendly)
- **Hook scene:** 0.5–1.5s cuts (fast)
- **Body scenes:** 1–3s average
- **Demo/proof scenes:** 2–4s (let the proof land)
- **CTA scene:** 2–5s (repeat the one action)

**Agent 4 should write with “beat changes”**: every 2–4 seconds, something changes:
- visual,
- claim,
- proof point,
- or curiosity loop.

---

## 3.3 Optimal UGC structures by length

### 15s UGC (one idea, one proof, one CTA)
**Best when:** strong product clarity, low friction offer, existing demand.

**Beat map (recommended)**
1) 0–2s: Hook (pain or surprising claim)
2) 2–6s: What it is + who it’s for
3) 6–12s: Proof (demo/result/social proof) + mechanism tag
4) 12–15s: CTA (single step)

**Common winning pattern:** “I had X → tried Y → this fixed it → here’s how.”

---

### 30s UGC (problem → mechanism → proof → objection → CTA)
**Beat map**
1) 0–3s: Hook
2) 3–10s: Problem + agitation / or before-state
3) 10–20s: Mechanism + how it works (1 sentence) + proof
4) 20–26s: Objection handling (“I thought…”) or guarantee
5) 26–30s: CTA + urgency

---

### 60s UGC (story + proof stack + close)
**Beat map**
1) 0–3s: Hook
2) 3–15s: Story (relatable struggle) + open loop
3) 15–35s: Mechanism + demo + proof stack (2–3 proof points)
4) 35–50s: Objections + who it’s for / who it’s not for
5) 50–60s: Offer + CTA + reminder proof

---

## 3.4 How to make scripts sound natural (not “copywriter-y”)
**The biggest failure mode for AI copywriters:** they write *written English* that nobody says.

**Agent 4 should apply a “spoken-language transform”**
- Replace formal transitions with speech markers:
  - “so,” “okay,” “here’s the thing,” “I’m not kidding,” “real quick”
- Prefer contractions: “don’t / didn’t / I’m”
- Use self-interruptions sparingly:
  - “—and the weird part is…”
- Use “because” more than “therefore”
- Keep sentences under ~12–14 words on average
- Put the “point” early in the sentence

**A practical test Agent 4 can run on itself**
- If a line cannot be read in one breath at ~150 WPM, split it.

---

## 3.5 Patterns in top-performing UGC scripts (what shows up repeatedly)
Across niches, high-ROAS UGC tends to share:
1) **Immediate specificity** (time, number, constraint)
2) **A believable narrator** (identity match)
3) **An anti-pattern** (what didn’t work before)
4) **A mechanism tag** (even a light one)
5) **Proof moment** (demo, screenshot, before/after, third-party mention)
6) **One clear CTA** (not “learn more + follow + comment + DM”)

---

# 4) Awareness-level-specific copy (Schwartz) → how scripts fundamentally change

Schwartz’s awareness levels (commonly taught as: Unaware, Problem-aware, Solution-aware, Product-aware, Most-aware) are referenced widely. ([leaderself.com](https://www.leaderself.com/summary/breakthrough-advertising-eugene-m-schwartz/?utm_source=openai))

## 4.1 Unaware
**Goal:** earn attention; create curiosity; hint at a new problem/belief.  
**Best frameworks:** Star–Story–Solution, Myth–Truth–Fix, pattern interrupts.  
**Copy traits**
- minimal product talk early
- more “entertainment value,” but with a point
- curiosity-open loops
**Example opening**
- “Nobody told me this is why my skin looked ‘fine’ but never *glowy*…”

## 4.2 Problem-aware
**Goal:** intensify pain + introduce “there’s a better way.”  
**Best frameworks:** PAS, BAB (if transformation).  
**Copy traits**
- heavy VOC mirroring
- “you’re not alone” normalization
- introduce mechanism as the “why you’re stuck”
**Example**
- “If you’ve tried [common fix] and it still [symptom], it’s usually because [root cause].”

## 4.3 Solution-aware
**Goal:** differentiate your approach from the category.  
**Best frameworks:** Claim–Proof–Offer, Objection-first, mechanism-first.  
**Copy traits**
- category comparison
- stronger mechanism naming
- proof earlier
**Example**
- “Most [category] do X. This one does Y—so you get Z.”

## 4.4 Product-aware
**Goal:** make them choose you now.  
**Best frameworks:** Offer stack, testimonial, objection handling, guarantee.  
**Copy traits**
- social proof, reviews, results
- pricing/offer clarity
- risk reversal
**Example**
- “If you were waiting for a sign—this is it. Here’s what you get…”

## 4.5 Most-aware
**Goal:** remove friction; add urgency; simplify decision.  
**Best frameworks:** Direct offer, reminder, last-chance, bonus/urgency.  
**Copy traits**
- short, direct, minimal education
- scarcity/urgency if real
- “tap to reorder / claim deal”
**Example**
- “Restock is live. Same bundle. Ends tonight.”

---

## 4.6 The “graduation” problem (audience moves up awareness)
As you scale spend, you often “educate” the market:
- Problem-aware becomes solution-aware,
- Solution-aware becomes product-aware,
- etc.

**Practical adaptation rule**
- If CPA rises and comments shift from “what is this?” to “does it work vs X?”, you’re graduating.
- Copy must shift from:
  - *teaching the problem* → *proving your mechanism* → *making a compelling offer*

**Agent 4 requirement**
- Each script should declare its intended awareness level:
  - `AWARENESS_TARGET: Problem-aware`
- So Agent 15B can later map performance to awareness and update prompts.

---

# 5) Paid-social-specific copy principles that matter (with practical implementation)

## 5.1 Specificity beats generality
- Specific numbers increase believability **when** they’re:
  - plausible,
  - tied to proof,
  - and not “miracle-y.”
Ogilvy-style information hooks are basically “specificity as the hook.” ([envision-creative.com](https://www.envision-creative.com/blog/david-ogilvy-advertising-lessons/?utm_source=openai))

**Agent 4 implementation**
- Require at least one:
  - time-to-result,
  - quantity,
  - comparison,
  - constraint (“without…”, “even if…”),
  - or measurable demo.

## 5.2 One ad, one idea
In short-form, multi-message ads usually feel like:
- clutter,
- low confidence,
- and are harder to cut/edit.

**Agent 4 enforcement**
- Add a field:
  - `SINGLE_CORE_PROMISE: <one sentence>`
- If the script contains 2 unrelated promises, it fails.

## 5.3 “Deadly sincerity” (admitting flaws)
This is how you survive skeptical feeds:
- “It’s not instant.”
- “It won’t work if you won’t do X.”
- “It’s not the cheapest.”
Counterintuitively, it makes the rest sound true.

**Agent 4 usage**
- Use especially in saturated niches.
- Put it right before proof or guarantee.

## 5.4 Pattern interrupts with words alone
Word-only pattern interrupts:
- “Stop scrolling if…”
- “I wish someone told me this sooner…”
- “Unpopular opinion: …”
- “I’m going to show you the ugly part…”

**But:** on Meta/TikTok, the *visual* interrupt matters too—Agent 4 should write for a visual beat change.

## 5.5 Emotional vs rational
**Rule of thumb**
- Emotion drives **attention** and **remembering**
- Rational/proof drives **permission to buy**

**Agent 4 structure**
- Lead emotional (pain/desire/identity)
- Resolve with rational (mechanism/proof/offer)

## 5.6 Social proof integration (without feeling pasted in)
Natural proof lines:
- “My friend sent me this…”
- “I kept seeing it, so I tried it…”
- “I took a screenshot because I didn’t believe it…”
- “Here’s day 1 vs day 7…”

## 5.7 CTA strategy (single CTA > multiple)
Short-form CTAs work best when they’re:
- one action,
- consistent with platform behavior,
- low friction.

**Agent 4 default**
- Use **one CTA**:
  - “Tap ‘Shop Now’”
  - “Click to take the 30-second quiz”
  - “Get the starter bundle”
Don’t stack: “comment + DM + follow + click”.

## 5.8 Conversational (“ugly”) vs polished
UGC often wins because it feels:
- native,
- honest,
- quick.

**Agent 4 choice rule**
- If audience is skeptical or niche is saturated: go more “imperfect human.”
- If premium brand positioning is core: keep conversational but cleaner.

## 5.9 Objection-handling in short scripts
You can’t handle 10 objections—pick **the top 1–2**:
- “Does it work for my hair type?”
- “Is it safe?”
- “Is it hard to use?”
- “Is it a subscription?”

**Agent 4 must have**
- `TOP_OBJECTION_HANDLED: <one>`
- and one line that resolves it.

---

# 6) Production-ready script output format (what editors + AI tools need)

## 6.1 Recommended structured format (JSON + human-readable table)
Agent 4 should output **both**:
1) A **human-readable storyboard script**
2) A **strict JSON** block for downstream agents/tools

### Human-readable format (example template)
**SCRIPT METADATA**
- Concept ID:
- Awareness Target:
- Platform: (Meta Reels / TikTok / YouTube Shorts)
- Length target: (15/30/60)
- Tone: (UGC casual / founder / expert)
- Big Idea:
- One Big Promise:
- Mechanism line:
- Proof assets needed: (before/after, screenshot, demo shot)
- Compliance flags: (no guarantees, no “before/after” etc.)

**BEAT SHEET (time-coded)**
| Time | Visual direction | Spoken dialogue | On-screen text | SFX/Music | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0–1.5 | selfie cam, close-up | “…” | “…” | whoosh | hook |
| 1.5–4.0 | cut to problem | “…” | “…” |  | VOC mirror |
| … | … | … | … | … | … |

### JSON schema (recommended fields)
```json
{
  "script_id": "",
  "concept_id": "",
  "awareness_target": "problem-aware",
  "duration_seconds": 30,
  "big_idea": "",
  "single_core_promise": "",
  "mechanism": {
    "name": "",
    "one_line_explanation": ""
  },
  "proof": [
    { "type": "demo|testimonial|ugc_result|authority", "asset_needed": "", "line": "" }
  ],
  "objection_handling": [
    { "objection": "", "response_line": "" }
  ],
  "cta": {
    "primary": "",
    "on_screen": "",
    "timing": "26-30s"
  },
  "beats": [
    {
      "t_start": 0.0,
      "t_end": 1.5,
      "scene_type": "hook",
      "visual": "",
      "spoken": "",
      "on_screen_text": "",
      "captions": "",
      "sfx_music": "",
      "editor_notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

## 6.2 Notation rules that reduce production errors
- **Spoken ≠ On-screen**: don’t duplicate every word; on-screen should compress to the 핵심.
- Add **shot type** tags:
  - `A-roll selfie`, `B-roll demo`, `overlay screenshot`, `text-only`
- Add **asset callouts**:
  - `INSERT: app screen recording`
  - `INSERT: review screenshot (5-star)`
- Add **caption safety**:
  - keep lines short, avoid dense legalese

# 7) How to implement this into Agent 4’s internal “decision engine”

## 7.1 Agent 4 framework selection logic (simple rules)
1) If awareness = **Problem-aware** → default **PAS**
2) If awareness = **Solution-aware** → **Claim–Proof–Offer** or **Objection-first**
3) If awareness = **Product-aware** → **Testimonial/BAB + Offer**
4) If awareness = **Unaware** → **Star–Story–Solution** with curiosity
5) If the concept’s differentiator is a **mechanism** → put mechanism line by second 10 (or earlier)

## 7.2 Agent 4 quality gates (must-pass)
- **One idea**: single core promise present and consistent
- **Mechanism line** exists (even minimal)
- **Proof moment** exists (or explicit asset request)
- **Top objection** addressed
- **CTA singular** and clear
- **Pacing**: word count fits duration at ~150–160 WPM ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute?utm_source=openai))
- **On-screen readability** respects overlay speed guidance ([ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/creative-best-practices?utm_source=openai))

---

## 8) What I still need from you to tailor this into a “drop-in Agent 4 spec”
If you answer these, I can convert this research into a *final agent prompt + scoring rubric + JSON validator rules*:

1) Your primary verticals (ecom, info, lead gen, app install, local services)?
2) Typical offer types (free trial, discount, quiz, VSL, call booking)?
3) Compliance constraints (health claims, before/after bans, finance, housing/employment)?
4) Will Agent 4 output **one script per concept** or **3 variants** (different structures) per concept?

If you want, I’ll also generate:
- a **library of 30 hook-openers** mapped to awareness level,
- a **mechanism-line generator** (templates),
- and a **UGC “sounds human” rewrite transform** that Agent 4 runs automatically before output.
